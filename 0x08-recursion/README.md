This is my introduction to recussion.
A topic that has been the most dificult for me to graps so far.
I honestly am still not very confortable with it right now.
I want to be able to look back and say 
"What exactly didn't I understand at first,
this is so easy"
As I have with other topic.
I know I wouldn't get there unless I decide to do hard thing.
And slash my deamons.
Vamoooosssss!!
